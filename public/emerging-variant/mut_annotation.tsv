H1N1 variants were analyzed by hemagglutination assay using RBCs that contained either {alpha}2-3SAL or {alpha}2-6SAL. The Q226R variants were only able to bind {alpha}2-3SAL-resialylated RBCs. Thus, amino acid change Q226R abolished virus receptor binding specificity to {alpha}2-6SAL. Wild-type sequence not available in Genbank. It is IMPORTANT to note that this mutation is a common egg or cell culture adaptation, therefore its effect would only be relevant for surveillance if the mutation is also found in the original clinical sample.

It has been found to alter host cell receptor specificity from human alpha-2,6 to also include avian-like alpha-2,3 sialic acid which is more common in ciliated human cells of the lower respiratory tract. While this mutation has been found in higher proportions in severe cases, it is IMPORTANT to note that it also can occur as egg or cell culture adaptation. Therefore, its effect would only be relevant for surveillance if the mutation is also found in the original clinical sample."	other (explain in comments)	host specificity shift	D239G	239	D	D	G					Sebastian Maurer-Stroh
